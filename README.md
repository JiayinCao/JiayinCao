My name is Jiayin Cao. Iâ€™m currently working at Ready At Dawn as a senior graphics engineer. Prior to joining Ready At Dawn, I used to work at Naughty Dog, Ubisoft Singapore and NVIDIA Shanghai before. My primary interest covers the following areas,

- Real-time Rendering
- Offline Rendering
- GPGPU
- GPU architecture
- Mathematics

This place is my home for my spare time projects. Following are three open-source projects of mine that I worked on before,
- [SORT](http://sort-renderer.com/), a physically based offline renderer.
- [TSL](https://jiayincao.github.io/Tiny-Shading-Language/), a programmable shading language for CPU ray tracers.
